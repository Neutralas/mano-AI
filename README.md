# My Personal Projects

The repository for all small/quick projects I've done in my free time.

If you don't understand any of them, keep in mind that they might have been documented in Lithuanian, as they were written while I was still in school.

Hope these projects inspire you to go and try to solve interesting problems yourself!

Have a lovely day,
Simonas
